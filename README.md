# Application04

**Overview of Repository**

This application makes use of the inbuilt R dataset called WorldPhone which consist of number of telephones in different continent. I have manipulated and analyzed this dataset. 

The main purpose of this repository is to make use of package called **"gganimate"**. This package extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. This package is available on CRAN. I have used transition_time, transition_reveal and transition_states function to show some beautiful annimation on WorldPhone dataset.
